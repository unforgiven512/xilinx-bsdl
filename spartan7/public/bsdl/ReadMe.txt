1. REVISION HISTORY 

            Readme  
Date        Version      Revision Description
=========================================================================
31JUL2016   1.0          Initial Xilinx release.
15MAR2017   1.1          Added devices, remove 'grp' suffix.
5MAY2017    1.2          Added FTGB196 files.
=========================================================================


2. OVERVIEW


These are the IEEE Std 1149.1 Boundary Scan Description Language (BSDL) 
files generated by Xilinx. These BSDL files are boundary-scan models for 
unconfigured FPGAs. Refer to the Vivado write_bsdl tool to generate BSDL
files for a specific FPGA configuration.

For more information on BSDL files, see:

What is BSDL, and how do I read a BSDL file?
www.xilinx.com/support/answers/8350.htm


3. SOFTWARE TOOLS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

These files may be used on any computer platform. They are text files. 

Software:
  -- Vivado Design Suite


4. DESIGN FILES

See FileMap.txt for a list of supported devices and their associated BSDL 
file names.  This is the file from the Vivado BSDL directory that describes 
how each BSDL file aligns to a specific part.


5. INSTALLATION AND OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS 

Back up the original files before copying files from the Xilinx Download
Center to the Vivado installation directory.  The BSDL files used by the
Vivado Design Suite are located in the directory
Vivado/<version>/data/parts/xilinx/spartan7/public/bsdl/


For use with boundary-scan test tools, follow these instructions:
 
A.	Use these files with your boundary-scan test tool to generate 
        boundary-scan tests on unconfigured FPGAs, or use the write_bsdl
        tool to generate a BSDL file for boundary-scan test on a 
        specific FPGA configuration.
B.	Review the design warnings in the BSDL file for special test 
        procedures.


6. SUPPORT

To obtain technical support for these BSDL files, go to 
www.xilinx.com/support to locate answers to known issues in the Xilinx
Answers Database.  Enter text 'bsdl' in the text search box at the top
of the page. For additional support options, see the Additional
Resources on the Support page.
