2. OVERVIEW

This readme describes how to use the files in xc2c.zip. 


These are the IEEE Std 1149.1 Boundary Scan Description Language (BSDL) 
files generated by Xilinx. These BSDL files are boundary-scan models for 
unprogrammed CPLDs. Refer to the ISE BSDLAnno tool to generate BSDL files
for a specific CPLD design.

For more information on BSDL files, see:

What is BSDL, and how do I read a BSDL file?
www.xilinx.com/support/answers/8350.htm

What is BSDLAnno? How do I use it to create a post-configuration BSDL
file?

3. SOFTWARE TOOLS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

These files may be used on any computer platform. They are text files.

5. INSTALLATION AND OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS 

Installation and use of these files is dependent on the type of system
you are using and the purpose for using these files. 

Back up the original files before copying these files to the
installation directory.  The BSDL files used by the ISE Design Suite
are located in the directory ISE_DS/ISE/xbr/data.

For use with boundary-scan test tools, follow these instructions:
 
A.	Use these files with your boundary-scan test tool to generate 
        boundary-scan tests on unprogrammed CPLDs, or use the 
        BSDLAnno tool to generate a BSDL file for boundary-scan test
        on a specific CPLD design.
B.	Review the design warnings in the BSDL file for special test 
        procedures.


6. SUPPORT

To obtain technical support for these BSDL files, go to 
www.xilinx.com/support to locate answers to known issues in the Xilinx
Answers Database.  Enter text 'bsdl' in the text search box at the top
