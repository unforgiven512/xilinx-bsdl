2. OVERVIEW

This readme describes how to use the files in xc6s.zip. 


These are the IEEE Std 1149.1 Boundary Scan Description Language (BSDL) 
files generated by Xilinx. These BSDL files are boundary-scan models for 
unconfigured FPGAs. Refer to the BSDLAnno tool to generate BSDL files for 
a specific FPGA configuration.

For more information on BSDL files, see:

What is BSDL, and how do I read a BSDL file?
www.xilinx.com/support/answers/8350.htm

What is BSDLAnno? How do I use it to create a post-configuration BSDL
file?

5. INSTALLATION AND OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS 

Installation and use of these files is dependent on the type of system
you are using and the purpose for using these files. 

Back up the original files before copying these files to the
installation directory.  The BSDL files used by the ISE Design Suite
are located in the directory
ISE_DS/ISE/<family>/data.
For the Spartan-6 FPGAs, the <family> is spartan6.

For use with boundary-scan test tools, follow these instructions: 
A.	Use these files with your boundary-scan test tool to generate 
        boundary-scan tests on unconfigured FPGAs, or use the BSDLAnno 
        tool to generate a BSDL file for boundary-scan test on 
        a specific FPGA configuration.
B.	Review the design warnings in the BSDL file for special test 
        procedures.

For use with configured devices, refer to the important information at
http://www.xilinx.com/support/answers/56363.htm

6. SUPPORT

To obtain technical support for these BSDL files, go to 
www.xilinx.com/support to locate answers to known issues in the Xilinx
Answers Database.  Enter text 'bsdl' in the text search box at the top
of the page. For additional support options, see the Additional
Resources on the Support page.
